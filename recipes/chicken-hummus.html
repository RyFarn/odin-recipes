        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>200g hummus</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
            <li>200g cooked mixed grains</li>
            <li>150g baby spinach</li>
            <li>1 avocado</li>
            <li>1 cooked chicken breast</li>
            <li>100g pomegranate seeds</li>
            <li>1/2 red onion</li>
            <li>2 tbsp toasted almonds</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Mix 2 tbsp of the hummus with half the lemon juice, the lemon
                 zest and enough water to make a drizzly dressing. Squeeze the 
                 grain pouch to separate the grains, then divide between two shallow 
                 bowls and toss through the dressing. Top each bowl with a handful
                  of the spinach.</li>
            <li>Squeeze the remaining lemon juice over the avocado halves, then 
                add one half to each bowl. Divide the chicken, pomegranate seeds, onion, 
                almonds and remaining hummus between the two bowls and gently mix everything 
                together just before eating.</li>
        </ol>

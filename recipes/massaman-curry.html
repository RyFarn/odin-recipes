            <li>jasmine rice, to serve</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6, then roast the peanuts on a baking 
                tray for 5 mins until golden brown. When cool enough to handle, 
                roughly chop. Reduce oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tbsp coconut milk (use the cream on top if there is any) 
                in a large casserole dish with a lid. Add the curry paste and fry for 1 min, 
                then stir in the beef and fry until well coated and sealed.</li>
            <li>Stir in the rest of the coconut with half a can of water, 
                the potatoes, onion, lime leaves, cinnamon, tamarind, sugar, fish sauce
                 and most of the peanuts. Bring to a simmer, then 
                cover and cook for 2 hrs in the oven until the beef is tender.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with sliced chilli and the remaining peanuts, 
                then serve straight from the dish with jasmine rice.</li>
        </ol>
